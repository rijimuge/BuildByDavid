      <h2 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Why I started kaggling</h2>
      <div className="indent-4 opacity-60">May 12 2024</div>
      <p>
        Firstly, I&apos;d like to acknowledge that I&apos;ve coined the
        neologism kaggling (although certainly I am not the first to do so with
        this particular word) by affixing the gerundive suffix to kaggle. With
        that out of the way....
      </p>
      <p>
        Virtually everyone is familiar with the concept that the best way to
        learn is by doing, but less people are familiar with the advantages of
        gamification of learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kaggle, in a very simple way, does a spectacular job of capturing two
        essential and not necessarily linked aspects of gamification:
        competition and a satisfying loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those inclined to it, being able to compare your results to others
        competing on the same task brings a sort of dopamine reaction that
        focuses your attention and helps you maintain energy for… continuing to
        compete.
      </p>
      <p>
        A loop is a concept that you will recognize if you&apos;re familiar with
        modern game design theory, or just played nearly any game long enough.
        It&apos;s sort of an atomic unit of activity where each iteration has a
        familiar structure, but ideally, there is an endless opportunity for
        improvement or optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Kaggle, you&apos;re typically competing to optimize a model against a
        set metric—accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error, etc. Each submission
        can be seen as one iteration of this loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each loop you optimize your data, you learn to tweak parameters, and
        hyper-parameters, you learn about different types of machine learning
        algorithms, each with unique characteristics and applications i.e.
        decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble methods. As you experiment
        with different strategies and integrate feedback from each submission,
        your skills in model building, feature engineering, and algorithm
        selection improve. It can be quite fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        All that&apos;s to say, the reason I started submitting to Kaggle was
        mainly because I was curious. I wondered how long it would take to
        improve my results, and to understand why my results were getting
        better. I thought I might enjoy it, but I was genuinely surprised to
        found that I enjoy it as much as I do. I&apos;d absolutely encourage
        anyone who has even an inkling of curiosity about the subject to check
        out some of their tutorial challenges.
