        Should I Start a Blog?

      <p>
        Apparently, yes! Here it is, such as it is. Let me explain how I reached
        my decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last 10 years, I&apos;ve had a writing practice that consisted
        of writing anything that came into my mind for 30 minutes a day in the
        morning. I started this after listening to a Tim Ferris podcast where
        the guest recommended everyone write something, anything, first thing in
        the mornings. I tried it out and liked it, and have mostly kept it up
        since then.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Just the writing itself is valuable. It offers an opportunity to give
        form to the thoughts bouncing around in my head, that potentially
        influence me. Left alone, without the benefit of the critical reflection
        that may be necessary to lend the thought a mooring in reality, morality
        or rationality, these thoughts could be downright destructive! Or
        potentially life-changing ideas may never receive the attention to
        flourish from their incipient state into fully formed notions.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        One of the best things about starting a blog is, whatever you&apos;re
        hoping to achieve, it may still be a good idea. A blog, at its best, is
        something like an essay, and essays have been around in some form for
        thousands of years. Why? Because people find value in writing them, and
        people find value in reading them.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Blogs are an amazingly resilient form if you define them as an evolution
        of the essay. They have remained a viable business model unto
        themselves, in the 21st century through all manner of disruptions,
        technological and otherwise, proving that there is an inherent value to
        the form that will survive into the foreseeable future.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        However, I&apos;m not trying to persuade you to start a blog--if
        anything, I&apos;m trying to persuade you to read mine. And with good
        reason. The hope is that more attention, more eyes on my blog, will lead
        to more opportunities.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        But, honestly, I think what appeals to me most is the notion that my
        thoughts, the stuff of my conscious existence, will be shared with and
        maybe even processed by other people.
